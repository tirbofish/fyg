# fyg

fyg *(pronounced as fig)* is another build tool for building Kotlin projects without the mess of having to deal with 
tools like Gradle and Maven.

This project was stemmed from my hatred towards gradle (hence the name) due to it's complexity and difficulty for new users as well as bloated contents.
